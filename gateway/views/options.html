		      Start the process of funding your idea. There are several options for getting the
		      funding you need to take your idea into production, some cater to specific groups
		      and others are fairly open. Several ways of building the capital you need are
		      available, whether you want to try and obtain funding by providing incentives to
		      potential investors or to try and get funding by selling equity or future profits.
		      Starting this process is often free to try but most have some sort of charge on the
		  	  funding you raise ranging from 4% - 12%, based on the system they use.<br />

            <p>Kickstarter is a popular site it has over1 billion dollars promised to
            projects.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Kickstarter has and atomic model for funding either the project is fully
            funded or the project recieves no funding. Which creates a system that avoids
            half funded projects.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Allows for the backing of a wide variety of projects that fit into any of

            Music, Photography, Publishing, Technology, and Theater.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Cons</p><br />

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Kickstarter takes 5% of all funding of a funded project.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Kickstarter does not allow for charity projects or projects that use
            charity donations as an incentive.</p>
          </li>

      </div>

      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>Indiegogo is a flexible crowdfunding website, similar in basic policy to
        kickstarter with a bit more flexibility, but higher usage costs. The site follows
        a similar model for getting a backing, but has less restrictions in the projects
        and payment plans.</p>

        <p>Pros</p><br />

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Two funding options flexible which allows for projects to keep funding
            even if they don't reach their goal. Or fixed funding which allows for an
            alll or nothing approach.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>open to non-profit ventures and personal funding, very flexible in
            accepted projects.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Cons</p><br />

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>If using a flexible plan there is a 4% funding fee if project is fully
            funded 9% funding fee if project fails.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>If using a fixed plan there 4% base funding fee if the project
            succeeds.</p>

      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>Crowdfunder is different from kickstarter and indiegogo in that as an
        incentive it allows users to actually sell partial ownership of their startup.
        Rather than just offering rewards for backing them they go for a backing that
        gives the investor a share of profits or equity.</p>
